# Locating the DWARF Debug Info for a WebAssembly File # {#locating}

The DWARF debug info for a WebAssembly file is either embedded in the WebAssembly file itself, or it is in a separate, external file. A WebAssembly file should not have both embedded DWARF and external DWARF; if this is the case, a DWARF consumer may use either DWARF debug info or it may consider the WebAssembly to lack DWARF debug info.

## Embedding DWARF Within a WebAssembly File ## {#embedding-DWARF}

The DWARF sections are embedded in Wasm binary files as custom sections. Each custom section's name matches the DWARF section name as defined in the DWARF standard, e.g. `.debug_info` or `.debug_line`.

Note: The full list of DWARF sections and the relationships between them are available in Appendix B of [[!DWARF]].

Note: Embedding each DWARF section in its own custom section within the Wasm binary matches how DWARF is embedded into other binary formats. For example with ELF binaries, each DWARF section is embedded as an ELF section, and similar for Mach-O binaries (although the "." in the section name is substituted with "__" in Mach-O).

<div class="example">

Here is the output of `wasm-objdump --headers` on a Wasm binary that has embedded DWARF debug info:

## External DWARF File ## {#external-DWARF}

Note: Existing external DWARF debug info schemes have typically been designed for reducing the amount of debug info that a linker must process and relocate (see "Appendix F: Split DWARF Object Files" in [[DWARF]]). On the other hand, the motivation for external DWARF files with WebAssembly is to reduce the size of the WebAssembly file to speed up network transfers. If a WebAssembly file is served over HTTP and its DWARF debug info is not needed, then the WebAssembly file can be downloaded more quickly if the DWARF is external.

A WebAssembly file that has external DWARF contains a custom section named "external_debug_info". The contents of the custom section contain a UTF-8 encoded URL string that points to the external DWARF file.

Note: It is preferable that the URL will be in relative form, relative to the WebAssembly file, to make DWARF debug info relocatable and consumable from an alternative or cached location.

<pre>
external_debug_info ::= <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/modules.html#binary-section">section<sub>0</sub></a>(ed_data)

ed_data        ::= b∗:<a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/conventions.html#binary-vec">vec</a>(<a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/values.html#binary-byte">byte</a>)                      (if <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/values.html#binary-utf8">utf8</a>(ed_field_value) = b*)
</pre>

Note: A command line tool might prefer to use file paths, while browser devtools might prefer to use a URL. The `ed_data` field needs to be decoded according to "file" URI Scheme rules when it needs to be used as a file path, which can be environment specific.

If the "external_debug_info" section is present, any DWARF debug info WebAssembly sections are ignored. A DWARF producer needs to remove such sections to reduce the size of the WebAssembly file. If more than one valid "external_debug_info" section is present, consumers will use the last one.

The external DWARF file pointed to by the `ed_data` must be a WebAssembly file with [[#embedding-DWARF|embedded DWARF debug info]]. A DWARF consumer should ignore any non-DWARF WebAssembly sections in this file, including instances of "external_debug_info" sections.

Note: The relocatable WebAssembly file may contain sections that are used to assist with updating references to data locations or code instructions. In this case, the relocatable sections for DWARF debug info section needs can be present in the external DWARF file to assist code producers.

# Consuming and Generating DWARF for WebAssembly Code # {#webassembly-code}

Note: Some DWARF constructs don't map one-to-one onto WebAssembly constructs. We strive to enumerate and resolve any ambiguities here.

## Code Addresses ## {#pc}

Note: DWARF associates various bits of debug info with particular locations in the program via its code address (instruction pointer or PC). However, WebAssembly's linear memory address space does not contain WebAssembly instructions.

Wherever a code address (see 2.17 of [[DWARF]]) is used in DWARF for WebAssembly, it must be the offset of an instruction relative within the `Code` section of the WebAssembly file. The DWARF is considered malformed if a PC offset is between instruction boundaries within the `Code` section.

Note: It is expected that a DWARF consumer does not know how to decode WebAssembly instructions. The instruction pointer is selected as the offset in the binary file of the first byte of the instruction, and it is consistent with the [[wasm-web-api#conventions]] definition of the code location.

<div class="example" heading=".debug_line Instruction Pointers">
The `.debug_line` DWARF section maps instruction pointers to source locations. With WebAssembly, the `.debug_line` section maps `Code` section-relative instruction offsets to source locations.
</div>

<div class="example" heading="DW_AT_* Attributes">
For entities with a single associated code address, DWARF uses the `DW_AT_low_pc` attribute to specify the associated code address value. For WebAssembly, the `DW_AT_low_pc`'s value is a `Code` section-relative instruction offset.

For entities with a single contiguous range of code, DWARF uses a pair of `DW_AT_low_pc` and `DW_AT_high_pc` attributes to specify the associated contiguous range of code address values. For WebAassembly, these attributes are `Code` section-relative instruction offsets.

For entities with multiple ranges of code, DWARF uses the `DW_AT_ranges` attribute, which refers to the array located at the `.debug_ranges` section.

<!-- ## Data Addresses ## {#data-addresses} -->

<!-- The location in memory, e.g. expressions that point to static variables defined on a heap, has the same definition as in traditional architectures. -->

<!-- ### .debug_info structures information ### {#debug_info_stucture} -->

<!-- The `.debug_info` section also describes structures [[wasm-debugging-capabilities/#type-of-binding|ᴿtype-of-binding]]. These description include the structure field types and locations. A consumer (e.g. a debugger) can format the variable display based on this type information [[wasm-debugging-capabilities/#reconstruct-a-bindings-value|ᴿreconstruct-a-bindings-value]]. -->

## DWARF Expressions and Location Descriptions ## {#DWARF-expressions-and-location-descriptions}

<div class="note">
Note: To enable the recovery of the values of variables, parameters, statics, etc... of a debuggee program at runtime, DWARF has *location descriptions* (see 2.6 of [[DWARF]]). There are four kinds of base, non-composite location description:

1. Empty location descriptions (see 2.6.1.1.1 of [[DWARF]]) are used for optimized-away variables, or data that is otherwise unavailable.

2. Memory location descriptions (see 2.6.1.1.2 of [[DWARF]]) are used when a value is located at some address in memory.

3. Register location descriptions (see 2.6.1.1.3 of [[DWARF]]) are used when a value is located in a register.

4. Implicit location descriptions (see 2.6.1.1.4 of [[DWARF]]) are used when a value does not have any runtime representation, but has a known value anyways.

Each of these location descriptions are applicable to values in WebAssembly, and may be used as they normally are, except for the third: register location descriptions. WebAssembly does not have registers per se. Instead, it has three distinct kinds of virtual registers (globals, locals, and the operand stack) and may use up to 2<sup>32</sup> - 1 instances of each virtual register.
</div>

When a program object's value is stored in a WebAssembly local, global, or on the operand stack it must be encoded as an extended DWARF operation. The meanings of the existing DWARF location does not match definitions of local, global, or operands stack. The proposed format for the extension is:

<pre>
wasm-ext := DW_OP_WASM_location wasm-op

DW_OP_WASM_location := 0xEB ;; available DWARF extension code

wasm-op := wasm-local | wasm-global | wasm-operand-stack

wasm-local := 0x00 i:uleb128

wasm-global := 0x01 i:uleb128

wasm-operand-stack := 0x02 i:uleb128
</pre>

<table class=index>
  <caption>Summary of encoding WebAssembly-specific constructs</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>DWARF Register Number</th><th>WebAssembly Construct</th><th>Meaning of the argument</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td><td>Local</td><td>The i<sup>th</sup> local of the function.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td><td>Global</td><td>The i<sup>th</sup> global of the module.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td><td>Operand Stack</td><td>The i<sup>th</sup> item on the operand stack.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note: This approach leverages DWARF's vendor extensibility (see 7.1 of [[DWARF]]) to reserve custom DWARF expression opcodes for WebAssembly-specific location descriptions. The encoding provides the basic set of need operators. In the future, it is possible to extend this set with a more compact encoding scheme, as well as adding specific DWARF extensions for a set of commonly used WebAssembly-specific location.

Note: The WebAssembly does not impose a limit of the maximum amount of local or globals. It will be a challenge to agree on an encoding scheme to represent WebAssembly locations listed above as registers, as well as documenting this scheme in the DWARF standard.

### Locals ### {#location-descriptions-locals}

If a value is located in the currently executing function's i<sup>th</sup> local.

The value's location description must be encoded as a `DW_OP_WASM_location 0x00` operation with i as its ULEB128-encoded operand.

### Global ### {#location-descriptions-globals}

If a value is located in the i<sup>th</sup> global.

The value's location description must be encoded as a `DW_OP_WASM_location 0x01` operation with i as its ULEB128-encoded operand.

### Operand Stack ### {#location-descriptions-operand-stack}

If a value is located in the i<sup>th</sup> entry on the operand stack, then its DWARF register location is register 2 offset i, where 0 <= i < length(operand stack). i = 0 is the bottom of the operand stack.

The value's location description must be encoded as a `DW_OP_WASM_location 0x02` operation with i as its ULEB128-encoded  operand.

Note: Using i = 0 as the bottom of the operand stack means that location descriptions will not need to be updated as frequently as if i = 0 were the top of the operand stack, since Wasm instructions are constantly pushing to and popping from the operand stack.
